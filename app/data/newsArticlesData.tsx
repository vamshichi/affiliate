Apple is developing a new iPhone SE, which it plans to release in early 2025 at a low cost. The information was provided by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, who also mentioned that an upgraded Magic Keyboard will be included with two new iPad Air versions.

Based on the iPhone 14, the fourth iPhone SE will be released. This implies that Apple will integrate Face ID instead of the home button. Given that the phone is expected to sport one of the company's most recent chipsets, Apple Intelligence may also be included.

Redesigned Mac minis, updated MacBook Pros, and iMacs with an M4 chip are also planned for 2025. New MacBook Airs, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro devices will also be able to access the platform. The journalist did note, though, that since the current iPad Pro is already "a generation ahead," it's possible that we won't see a new model in 2025.`,

    title:'OpenAI introduces a new "Canvas" Customized ChatGPT interface for writing and coding tasks',
    image:openAi,
    date:'october 4,2024',
    content:`On Thursday, OpenAI unveiled a brand-new interface for using ChatGPT that it calls "canvas." The software opens a workspace for writing and coding tasks in a separate window that opens next to the standard chat window. Users can write directly on the canvas or use code, then highlight specific areas of their work to have the model make edits. On Thursday, Canvas will go live in beta for ChatGPT Plus and Teams users; Enterprise and Edu users will get it the following week.

A number of consumer AI companies are coming together around editable workspaces as a useful application of generative AI. Similar functionalities are available in ChatGPT's new interface as in Anthropic's Artifacts, which was released in June, and Cursor, the popular coding companion. To expand its paid user base, OpenAI is rushing to match rival services and introduce whole new features in ChatGPT.

Even if AI chatbots nowadays aren't able to do complex tasks with just one instruction, they can frequently provide a useful beginning point. Editable workspaces, such as canvas, let users make corrections to incorrect portions of an AI chatbot's output without requiring them to carefully examine their prompt and write a new section of code.

In a demo with TechCrunch, OpenAI product manager Daniel Levine stated, "This is just a more natural interface for collaborating with ChatGPT."

Levine was required to choose "GPT-4o with canvas" from ChatGPT's model picker drop-down menu during our demonstration. But according to OpenAI, ChatGPT will only display canvas windows when it determines that having a separate workspace could be useful—for example, for lengthy outputs or intricate coding jobs. To open a project window automatically, you may alternatively just write "use canvas."

Levine demonstrated to TechCrunch how the new features of ChatGPT could facilitate email writing. An email generated by ChatGPT can be requested by users, and it will appear in the canvas window. Next, users have the option to change the writing's length by toggling a slider. Additionally, you can highlight particular lines and instruct ChatGPT to add emojis or make changes like "make this sound friendlier." Additionally, users can request that ChatGPT translate the entire email into a different language.

The coding canvas has a few somewhat distinct features. Levine gave ChatGPT instructions to launch a Python API web server, which materialized on the canvas window. ChatGPT allows users to add in-line documentation explaining the code in simple terms by clicking the "add comments" button. Furthermore, you may ask the chatbot to explain anything to you or ask questions about it by highlighting a line of code that ChatGPT produced. Additionally, ChatGPT will gain a new "review code" button that will offer specific revision suggestions for any user-written or automatically generated code in the window for the user to accept, reject, or modify themselves. Should they click "approve," ChatGPT will attempt to resolve the issues on its own.  OpenAI states that it intends to make canvas available to free users as well as it exits beta.`,

      date:'october 4,2024',
      content:`M&M described the response as "unprecedented" and stated that it will gradually notify consumers about the estimated delivery schedules over the course of the following three weeks.
Leading SUV manufacturer Mahindra & Mahindra received 1.76 lakh reservations for its recently released Thar ROXX in less than 60 minutes after the window opened. Delivery will start on October 12, which is Dussehra.

There is discussion over this being the highest first-day booking of any car from the Mahindra Group.

M&M described the response as "unprecedented" and stated that it will gradually notify consumers about the estimated delivery schedules over the course of the following three weeks. The SUV manufacturer stated that reservations for Thar ROXX are still available at all dealerships and on Mahindra's website.
With almost 51,000 SUVs sold in September, M&M reported a 24% YoY increase in SUV sales. At 3,027 units, exports increased by 25% YoY in September as well.

The starting price of the five-door Thar SUV, ROXX, is Rs 12.99 lakh. It comes in both petrol and diesel variants.
The Thar Roxx will be equipped with either a 2.0-litre mStallion turbo petrol engine that provides 160 bhp of maximum power and 330 Nm of torque, or a 2.0-litre mHawk diesel engine that puts out 150 horsepower and 330 Nm. Either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission is attached to each engine.
The Thar ROXX has been built as a mainstream SUV, taking into consideration the wants and requirements of purchasers in the market, rather than as a niche product, according to Rajesh Jejurikar, ED and CEO for the auto and farm company. Even with the three-door model, it has grown to be a significant volume player in its current configuration. Jejurikar has previously stated, "We didn't want to stop at that and we think that we can make this brand bigger."

Initial pricing for the 4x4 versions of the new Thar ROXX from Mahindra & Mahindra ranges from Rs 18.79 lakh to Rs 22.49 lakh (ex-showroom).`,

We think that everyone should have access to resources that support their creativity, regardless of whether they are an aspiring filmmaker seeking to break into Hollywood or a creator who enjoys creating videos for their audience. We are thrilled to present Meta Movie Gen, our ground-breaking generative AI study for media, encompassing picture, video, and audio modalities. Our most recent study shows how to create original films and audio, alter pre-existing videos, and turn your own photo into a personalized video using just basic language inputs. When assessed by humans, Movie Gen performs better on these tasks than comparable models in the market.

This endeavor is a continuation of our extensive and well-established history of disseminating basic AI research to the public. The Make-A-Scene set of models, which allowed for the generation of image, audio, video, and 3D animation, marked the beginning of our first wave of generative AI development. Diffusion models led to a second phase of development with Llama Image foundation models, enabling image modification and higher quality picture and video creation. Our third wave, Movie Gen, combines all of these modalities to provide users of the models even more precise control in a manner that has never been feasible before. As with earlier iterations, we expect these models to facilitate a range of new products that may spur innovation.

These foundation models have a lot of fascinating applications, but it's crucial to remember that generative AI cannot take the place of artists' and animators' labor. We are disseminating this information because we are convinced of the ability of technology to foster new forms of self-expression and to open doors for those who might not otherwise have them. It is our dream that everyone will eventually be able to use Movie Gen to produce high-quality videos and audio and realize their artistic dreams.`,

About 15 lakh spectators saw the amazing success of the IAF Air display at the Marina, however at the end of the display, two individuals were admitted to the hospital and five people died, while about 100 people had outpatient treatment at the government hospitals.
As early as 8 a.m., hundreds of people began to swarm Marina. People flocked to the beach to see the display, packing the buses, trains, and Metro for hours at a time.
Before long, the famous beach was clogged with traffic, and visitors had to walk a great distance to reach the marina.
Many had arrived with water and umbrellas in hand to shield themselves from the intense sun, following the advise. Thousands more had arrived unprepared as well. A senior police officer stated that five people who had come to see the air show fainted and died on Sunday afternoon after the event ended, when the crowd was enthralled by the numerous planes and their aerobatic skills. V. Karthikeyan, 34, of Thiruvottiyur's RMV Nagar neighborhood, had driven a two-wheeler with his wife and two-year-old son to the air show, according to the police. Following the occurrence, Karthikeyan passed out in the vicinity of the INS Adyar main gate while they were strolling down Rajaji Road. After being sent to the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital (RGGH), he was declared dead.

In a another incidence, D. John, 56, a resident of Korukkupet, passed out next to the Parthasarathy arch on Kamarajar Salai. He had come for the air show with his wife Elisamma and nephew. At the same location, Srinivasan from Perungalathur passed out as well. According to the police, both were taken in an ambulance to the Government Omandurar Multispeciality hospital, but to no avail.
On the Marina's dunes, a second gentleman in his late thirtys was discovered deceased. 
He was recognized by the police as Dinesh Kumar, and a post-mortem would be conducted on his body at Government Royapettah Hospital. 
Due to dizziness, around 100 patients were hospitalized to the government hospitals near the Marina. Forty-five patients were treated at the Government Royapettah Hospital, 43 at Omandurar Hospital, and seven at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). 

According to RGGGH Dean E. Therani Rajan, only two patients were admitted; the other patients received outpatient care. One patient was pronounced "dead on arrival" upon arriving at the hospital. The 34-year-old had no known medical conditions, but more details could only be obtained during a post-mortem, according to the Dean. 

Patients' main complaints were of extreme heat, humidity, and giddiness. "We received 43 complaints of giddiness from the same person. Increased temperature impairs the hypothalamus's ability to operate. The same is true for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which impairs key organ function. According to Dr. Therani Rajan, some persons have arrhythmia, or abnormal heartbeats, which can result in cardiac arrest and even death.

long though the audience was well-behaved and under control, thousands of people remained stranded for several hours long after the event ended because the public transportation systems malfunctioned. Many in the throng also expressed dissatisfaction with the government for failing to plan for facilities, particularly clean drinking water, for the sizable gathering.`,

According to a top company official on Sunday, Paytm's top focus right now is investing in its consumer payments business in an attempt to make up for lost user base as a result of RBI regulatory actions.
The RBI had prohibited Paytm Payments Bank from enabling credit transactions in client accounts, including prepaid cards and wallets, or taking deposits.

In order to concentrate on its primary business of financial services distribution and payment processing, Paytm sold its ticketing division to foodtech company Zomato in August for a sum of Rs 2,048 crore.
"Our major business is still processing payments, and the merchant side is still robust. Regulating restrictions, however, caused us to lose a sizable portion of our consumer base. During an interactive event hosted by the Calcutta Chapter of Young Indians, the youth wing of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma stated, "Going forward, we aim to reinvest in the consumer payments business area."

UPI payments are made by consumers, whereas QR code transactions are made by merchants.
The amount of monthly transactional users (MTU) dropped sharply from 10.4 crore in January to 7.7 crore in May, based on corporate data that is currently accessible. In June, the amount was 7.8 crore.
On the other hand, Paytm witnessed gradual expansion in the merchant segment, as seen by the rise in merchant numbers from 79 lakh during the June 2023 quarter to 109 lakh during the June 2024 quarter.

The company is utilizing the Third-Party Application Provider (TPAP) business model, according to Sharma.

It entails providing consumers with digital payment services through a range of platforms and apps. In order to streamline transactions and offer a user-friendly interface for services like bill payment, UPI payments, and other financial transactions, TPAPs work with banks and other financial institutions.`,

    content:`Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday to discuss a potential trade deal, and the two sides decided to support each other financially with over ₹6,300 crore. This agreement comes as the Maldives faced a foreign exchange crisis.

The two parties unveiled a new vision document for an all-encompassing economic and maritime security partnership, which includes important measures to increase trade, digitization, and financial cooperation as well as strengthen the Maldives' maritime surveillance capabilities through the supply of Indian radar systems and other equipment.

Following their discussions, Modi addressed a joint media conference with Muizzu to state that India is the Maldives' "closest neighbour and steadfast friend" and that it will continue to provide support in a variety of areas, including infrastructure development, defines, and development cooperation. 

The State Bank of India (SBI) has rolled over $100 million in Treasury bills for the Maldives this year. Speaking in Hindi, Modi stated that a currency exchange arrangement worth $400 million and ₹3,000 crore (₹30 billion) had been reached today in response to the Maldives' needs.

Muizzu, who took several measures to bring his nation closer to Beijing and lessen its reliance on New Delhi after winning the "India Out" election campaign last year, acknowledged India as a crucial ally for the development of infrastructure and socioeconomic conditions that "has stood by the Maldives during our times of need." 

"The Maldives will continue to be a true friend, dedicated to our shared vision of peace and development in our countries and our region," he continued.
As per Muizzu, the currency swap arrangement will play a crucial role in mitigating the current foreign exchange problems. Additionally, there was a consensus to "continue to be involved in initiatives that will strengthen the Maldives' economic stability and resilience." He said, not providing any specifics.

The Maldives side raised "a number of other points and requests" related financial aid, which will be looked into by New Delhi, according to Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri during a media conference. 

The results of the two-way meeting signalled a dramatic break from a particularly contentious period in New Delhi and Male's relationship. Ties plunged to an all-time low after Muizzu demanded India evacuate more than 80 Indian military personnel deployed in the archipelago to operate three aircraft and subsequently made moves to enhance defence and military cooperation with Turkey and China.`,

    content:`The W1 hybrid hyper car, was unveiled. Priced at a whopping GBP 2 million each, the cars are already assigned to clients.
Highlights
The W1, McLaren's replacement for the P1, has been revealed. 

399 units only, each costing GBP 2 million. 

driven by an electric motor coupled to a 4.0-liter V8 engine. 

Finally, McLaren Automotive has shown the eagerly anticipated P1 replacement. The British supercar manufacturer's most potent road-going vehicle to date is called the W1. According to McLaren, only 399 of the W1's high-priced, GBP 2 million vehicles will be produced; these vehicles have already been assigned to clients.
The W1 is the replacement for the P1, which was the F1's legendary heir. 

The RWD hyper car’s hybrid engine system combines a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 with an E-module, which is made up of an electric motor and a motor control unit with motorsport roots. The highest power output of any McLaren engine, 915 bhp, is produced by the flat-plane crank V8 alone, which can reach 9,200 rpm. An eight-speed dual-clutch transmission is used to transfer power to the back wheels. The 342 bhp electric motor, according to McLaren, weighs only 20 kg and has a particular output that is directly comparable to Formula 1 electric motors. The overall output is at 1258 horsepower and 1340 Nm of peak torque. 
The W1 can sprint from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.7 seconds, go from 0 to 200 kmph in 5.8 seconds, and go from 0 to 300 kmph in less than 12.7 seconds, with a maximum speed restriction of 350 kmph. 
The W1's design differs greatly from the rest of McLaren's line-up in terms of appearance. Its shape is less curved and more upright than that of the P1, its predecessor. The headlamps on the front end have an aggressive appearance, and there are several air vents to improve aerodynamic efficiency. Anhedral doors that are hinged to the roof and rotate upward are standard on the W1. The enormous rear haunches with air intakes that gather air from the outlets on the front wheel arches are among the other design features. 
The large diffuser and the slender, flowing tail lamps make up the majority of the back end.
The W1 has lightweight upholstery and movable pedals inside. Additional features include a Bowers & Wilkins sound system and an 8-inch touchscreen with Apple Carplay and Android auto compatibility.

The W1's advanced aerodynamic characteristics, which combine to produce a noteworthy 1000 kg of downforce, are another talking point. The pushrod and inboard damper system's lower wishbones have been increased considerably to add to the suspension's aerodynamic efficiency and maintain the car's rear-wheel drive's clean air flow. The ride height is decreased by 37 mm in the front and 17 mm in the back when Race mode is engaged.`,

      title:'Google begins releasing new features for Android phones that prevent theft.',
      date:'october 8,2024',
      content:`According to Google, these features are intended to improve security and protect user information in the event that a phone is stolen.
Announced at the I/O 2024 developer conference in May this year, Google has now begun rolling out its new enhanced theft protection capabilities for Android phones. According to Google, these features are intended to improve security and protect user information in the event that a phone is stolen. Android 10 or later versions of phones will support the three new functionalities.

Three new capabilities to prevent theft are available: Remote Lock, Offline Device Lock, and Theft Detection Lock.
Using Google AI, the Theft Detection Lock feature detects when someone snatches your phone out of your hand and tries to ride, drive, or run away with it. It will be promptly locked down to prevent your information from falling into the wrong hands if a theft motion is detected. 

When a thief attempts to disconnect your phone for an extended length of time, the Offline Device Lock function activates. The feature automatically locks your screen to help protect your data even while your device is off the grid. Android may also identify additional signals that your device may be in the wrong hands. 

The Remote Lock option can be useful if your phone has been stolen. Using just your phone number and a brief security challenge, you will be able to lock the screen of any device. Google writes in a blog post that "this buys you time to recover your account details and access additional helpful options in Find My Device, including sending a full factory reset command to completely wipe the device."
The features are being rolled out globally, albeit gradually. While some users may receive the features later, others may already have them. We checked on two Android phones but couldn’t see them, so it may take some time until the theft protection capabilities reach all Android users.`,
